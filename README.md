# Getting Started with Native Script (using Angular v4)
Native iOS and Android app for managing grocery lists built with NativeScript, following the [TypeScript and Angular getting started guide](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/tutorial/ng-chapter-0) and improving upon it.

## Requirements
To run this project, youâ€™ll need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). The latest version of Node.js is recommended. You'll also need a global installation of [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/ ). 

```
$ npm install -g nativescript
```

## Development

This app is built with the NativeScript CLI. Once you have the [CLI installed](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup), start by cloning the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/temilaj/NativeScript-Getting-Started.git
$ cd NativeScript-Getting-Started
```

From there you can use the `run` command to run Groceries on iOS:

```
$ tns run ios
```

And the same command to run Groceries on Android:

```
$ tns run android
```
